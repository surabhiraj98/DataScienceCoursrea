The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed. by ARTHUR SAMUEL
A computer program is said to learn from experience(E) with respect to some tasks(T) and performance measure (P), 
if its performance at task as measured by P , improves with experience E by Tom Mitchell

SUPERVISED LEARNING
IN this learning we are given a data set already and know what our correct output should look like,having the 
idea that their is a relationship between intput and output.they are further divided into two - regression and 
classification problems.
In Regression problem - we are trying to predict the result within the continuous output
means we are rying to map input variables to some continuous fucntion
In Classification problem - we are tring to predict results in a discrete output,that is trying to map intput into discrete categories.

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
It allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. we can derive structure from data 
where we dont necessarily know the effect of variables.
we can derive the structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data
there is no feedback based on the prediction results
