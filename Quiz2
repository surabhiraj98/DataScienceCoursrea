Question 01

Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well they did in their first year. Specifically, let x be equal to the number of "A" grades (including A-. A and A+ grades) that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). We would like to predict the value of y, which we define as the number of "A" grades they get in their second year (sophomore year).

Questions 1 through 4 will use the following training set of a small sample of different students' performances. Here each row is one training example. Recall that in linear regression, our hypothesis is alt text, and we use m to denote the number of training examples.
x 	y
3 	2
1 	2
0 	1
4 	3

For the training set given above, what is the value of m? In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).
Answer
4

Question 2

For this question, continue to assume that we are using the training set given above. Recall our definition of the cost function was J(θ0,θ1)=12m∑mi=1(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2. What is J(0,1)? In the box below, please enter your answer (use decimals instead of fractions if necessary, e.g., 1.5).

When θ0=0 and θ1=1, we have hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x=x. So, J(θ0,θ1)=12m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2=12∗4((1)2+(1)2+(1)2+(1)2)=48=0.5

Question 3

Suppose we set θ0=0, θ1=1.5. What is $h(\theta)_{(6)}$?

Setting x=2, we have hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x=11
Question 4

Let f be some function so that f(θ0,θ1) outputs a number. For this problem, f is some arbitrary/unknown smooth function (not necessarily the cost function of linear regression, so f may have local optima).

Suppose we use gradient descent to try to minimize f(θ0,θ1) as a function of θ0 and θ1. Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply.)

Your Answer Score Explanation No matter how θ0 and θ1 are initialized, so long as α is sufficiently small, we can safely expect gradient descent to converge to the same solution. Correct 0.25 This is not true, because depending on the initial condition, gradient descent may end up at different local optima. If the learning rate is too small, then gradient descent may take a very long time to converge. Correct 0.25 If the learning rate is small, gradient descent ends up taking an extremely small step on each iteration, and therefore can take a long time to converge. If θ0 and θ1 are initialized at the global minimum, the one iteration will not change their values. Correct 0.25 At the global minimum, the derivative (gradient) is zero, so gradient descent will not change the parameters. Setting the learning rate α to be very small is not harmful, and can only speed up the convergence of gradient descent. Correct 0.25 If the learning rate is small, gradient descent ends up taking an extremely small step on each iteration, so this would actually slow down (rather than speed up) the convergence of the algorithm.
