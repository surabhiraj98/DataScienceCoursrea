MATRICES AND VECTOR
Notation and terms:

    AijA_{ij}Aij​ refers to the element in the ith row and jth column of matrix A.
    A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.
    viv_ivi​ refers to the element in the ith row of the vector.
    In general, all our vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed. Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed.
    Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.
    "Scalar" means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.
    R refers to the set of scalar real numbers.
    Rn refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.
