3.Question 3

Let u be a 3-dimensional vector, where specifically

u=351

What is uTu^\text{T}uT?


[351]



4.Question 4

Let u and v be 3-dimensional vectors, where specifically

u=13−1

and

v=224

What is uTvu^TvuTv?

(Hint: uTu^TuT is a

1x3 dimensional matrix, and v can also be seen as a 3x1

matrix. The answer you want can be obtained by taking

the matrix product of uTu^TuT and vvv.) Do not add brackets to your answer.

5.Question 5

Let A and B be 3x3 (square) matrices. Which of the following

must necessarily hold true? Check all that apply.

If v is a 3 dimensional vector, then A∗B∗vA * B * vA∗B∗v is a 3 dimensional vector.

A+B=B+A
